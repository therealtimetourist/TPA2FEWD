Introduction to JavaScript 
•JavaScript is a programming language that provides action in applications. 
•Interactivityenables an end user to take an action in an application, usually by clicking a button or pressing a key. 
•A dynamic applicationadjusts and responds to such actions by end users. 
•JavaScript also expands the opportunities to animate content.

Alert Boxes 
•Alert boxes are commonly used to test the operation of JavaScript programs. 
•Generally not used in production code. 
•An alert box can help you ensure information is displayed to the user. 
•A user has to click OK to close an alert box.
 
JavaScript Statements 
•An ordinary JavaScript program is a sequence of statements. 
•Statements are separated by semi-colons. 
alert('This is the first alert'); 
alert('This is the second alert');

Functions 
•A functionis a segment of a program defined and performed in isolation from other parts. 
•JavaScript programmers sometimes identify functions that return no value as subroutines.

Functions (Continued) 
•The expression of a function—the “function example1() {. . .}” part—doesn’t perform any of the code within the function. 
•What you see in the source code is only the definition of a function. 
•When the function is invoked, executed, or launched, something useful happen.

Function Example Function Example

Links between HTML and JavaScript 
•Can include JavaScript code in <script> tags in <head> section of HTML file for small to medium-sized projects 
•For large amounts of code, reference a separate JavaScript file within the <script> tag: 
<script type = "text/javascript" src = path/filename.js"></script>

Variables 
•A JavaScript variablestands for a piece of data. 
•You use the var syntax to define a new variable in JavaScript: var firstname;

Identifiers 
•JavaScript identifiers are the names of variables and functions. 
•Identifiers cannot be the same as keywords already used in JavaScript. 
•For example, “if” has a special meaning in JavaScript statements and is not available as a variable name.

JavaScript Libraries 
•A library is collection of resources, like prewritten function code and subroutines, that developers use to create programs. 
•A JavaScript library is pre-written JavaScript code. 
•jQuery is the leading JavaScript library. 
•Other popular libraries include Dojo, MooTools, and YUI.

JavaScript Libraries (Continued) 
•When using a third-party library, include an element such as the following to reference the library: 
<script type = "text/javascript" src = "web or local address of the JavaScript library source"></script>

getElementById() Method 
•One important way to access display elements is with the getElementById() method. 
•This method returns a reference to the first object with the specified id or NAME attribute.

getElementById() Example 

Methods 
• Methods are JavaScript functions that belong to objects. 
• Methods differ from functions in that methods are always associated and used with a particular object. 
• isNaN() is an example of a JavaScript function. 
– Tests for “not a number”; if value = 0 (false), value is a number 
• document.getElementById() is an example of a JavaScript method; you can effectively only use getElementById with the special document object.

Events 
•Events are actions that trigger other actions to occur. 
•An event handleris an optional script or executable that handles input received in a program. 
Handlers are JavaScript code inside the <html> tags (rather than the <script> tags) that execute other JavaScript code in response to an event.

Events (Continued) 
•A callbackis a response to an event, such as a script execution in response to a mouse click.

onLoad Event Handler 
•The onLoad event handler “belongs” to HTML items; it triggers when its owner is complete. 
•The onLoad for an <img> image occurs when the image is fully rendered and visible. 
•The onLoad for a <table> fires once all the cells in that table have been drawn.

onLoad Example

onLoad Example (Continued) 

Flawed JavaScript Programs Are Erratic 
• Flawed JavaScript programs are erratic—they give different results at different times. 
• Reasons: –If the program depends on the existence of a particular screen element but doesn’t assure that the element exists 
–Launching the program at different times, resulting in slightly different loading order 
• Fix: Begin calculations only after onLoad has fired.

Showing and Hiding Elements 
•The HTML display attribute shows the user pertinent information and hides the information when no longer needed.

HTML display Attribute Example

HTML display Attribute Example (Cont.) 

Updating the Content of Elements 
•JavaScript uses the innerHTML property to change the current content of HTML elements (referred to as “inner content”) or insert new content.

innerHTML Example

Knowledge Assessment 
Fill in the Blank 
Complete the following sentences by writing the correct word or words in the blanks provided. 

1. A __computer program__ is a recipe we direct the computer to execute to result in a particular display or action 

2. You use the var syntax to define a new __variable__ in JavaScript. 

3. Many application requirements involve __events__, which are actions, such as a mouse click, that trigger other actions to occur. 

4. You notice that a part of your JavaScript program represents a sequence of actions that is logically separate from other parts of program. It likely will be useful to define a __function__ to perform that specific sequence. 

5. The __onload__ event associated with <body> constitutes a guarantee that all HTML has been displayed. 

6. A common coding pattern is to attach an id to a specific HTML element, then access that element through JavaScript with _getElementById()_. 

7. JavaScript __identifiers__ are the names of variables and functions. 

8. A __library__ is collection of resources, like pre-written code and subroutines, that developers use to create programs. 

9. A __JavaScript library__ is pre-written JavaScript code. 

10. More than half of leading Web sites use the __jQuery__ JavaScript library.
