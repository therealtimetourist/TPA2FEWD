Animation 
•Animation is the display of a sequence of static images at a fast enough speed to create the illusion of movement. 
•Regarding the user interface, animation has to do with changing a display to make it dynamic—not just a one-time change but a seamless one. 
•JavaScript can produce spectacular animation effects.

Recursion 
•Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself. 
•Recursion is a key part of animation. 
•The most effective way to introduce a “timing element” into JavaScript is to use setTimeout recursively.
 –Have it invoke another execution of the same function from which the setTimeout() was called.

createElement Method 
•You can use the JavaScript createElement method to display an image when a button is clicked or some other event occurs.

Canvas Element 
•To draw a canvas object, use:
 –getElementById() function to find the canvas element
 –canvas.getContext to create the canvas object 
 •Then use a variety of methods to draw shapes, include images, and so on.
 
Canvas Example: Analog Clock

Sending and Receiving Data 
•One of the most essential techniques for data transfer involves the XMLHttpRequest API.
 –Sometimes abbreviated as XHR 
 • XMLHttpRequest enables you to use JavaScript to pass data in the form of text strings between a client and a server.
 
XMLHttpRequest 
•General syntax:

XMLHttpRequest 
•The XMLHttpRequest object creates a call to the server. 
•The open method specifies the HTTP method for contacting the server and provides the server’s Web address. 
•The callback function gets a response from the server. 
• xhr.send(data) sends the data.

Accessing Data Example Accessing Data Example

Parsing 
•Parsing is a term used to describe analysis of complex information into constituent parts. 
•Use parsing for extracting information from a data stream of stock quotes and similar tasks. 

Parsing Example

Parsing Example 

JSON 
•You can also use JSON.parse and JSON.stringify APIs to exchange JavaScript objects with a server.

Loading and Saving Files 
•JavaScript can access files on a local computer and, using HTML5, validate the file type before loading, which greatly reduces errors.

Access a Local File Example

AppCache 
•AppCache saves a copy of Web site files locally, in a structured form. 
•AppCache is not the same as a browser’s cache. Whereas a browser’s cache saves all Web pages visited, AppCache saves only the files listed in the cache manifest.

AppCache Example 

Data Types 
• A data type is JavaScript’s interpretation of the kind of data a program can work with. 
• Data types include:
 – string
 – Number
 – Array
 –Boolean
 –Null
 –Object
 –undefined
 
User Input Form Validation 
•As end users enter data in a form, JavaScript can instantly validate entries and suggest alternatives.

Client-side Validation Example

Client-side Validation Example (Continued) 

Cookies 
•Cookies are small text files that Web sites save to a computer’s hard disk that contain information about the user and his or her browsing preferences. 
•The content of cookies change as a user revisits a site and selects different items or changes preferences. 
•In JavaScript, a cookie is a variable. 
•JavaScript can create and retrieve cookies.

Use Cookies Example 

Local Storage 
•HTML5’s Local Storage feature has better security and makes programming easier than with cookies.

Knowledge Assessment 
Fill in the Blank 
Complete the following sentences by writing the correct word or words in the blanks provided. 

1. __Animation__ is the display of a sequence of static images at a fast enough speed to create the illusion of movement. 

2. You need to draw a complex diagram as part of an HTML5 display. One way is with the __canvas__ element. 

3.  Before HTML5, the most common way to keep information on the client side of a Web application—that is, on the user’s computer—was with __ cookies__. [Possible alternative answer:  “hidden form variables”.] 

4. __XMLHttpRequest__ enables you to use JavaScript to pass data in the form of text strings, but not objects, between a client and a server. 

5.  __Recursion__ is a programming technique in which a function calls itself. 

6.  __Parsing__ is the label generally used for analysis of complex information into constituent parts. 

7.  The __AppCache__ API saves a copy of your Web site files locally, in a structured form. 

8.  Values in JavaScript appear in special different appearances, called __data types__, which are most often strings and numbers. 

9.  __JSON__ is a subset of JavaScript that enables you to exchange JavaScript objects with a server. 

10. __localStorage__ is an alternative to cookies.
